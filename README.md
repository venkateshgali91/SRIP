#deep learning
I am recently started the learning of machine learning and deep learning algorithms.
Here Task given by using cnn i try to slove the preparation neural network with a mnit dataset .
here in this the python  code is to predict a digit from mnit dataset using multilayer nueral network concept and jax python module.
Next Accuracy of the model is greater than 90 percent since it preedicts correctly 9 out 10 images.
